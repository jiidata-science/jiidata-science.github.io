I completed my undergraduate degree, in Mechanical Engineering, at University of Birmingham plenty of years ago. Since then I've been on a (relatively) varied career path, from Management Consulting to Data Science, but I've finally settled in the world of Data Science. Over the last few years I've worked for a popular high-street food retailer, a comparison site and at a cloud services consultancy - primarily focused on delivering customer-centric personalisation - whilst completing a masters in Analytics.

Sadly being a Data Scientist doesn't always make for easy introductory conversation in non-tech crowds. It typically goes along the lines of:

> New person: "Enough about me. So, what do you do for a living?"

> Me: "I'm actually a Data Scientist at [insert current company name here]"

> New person: "Ah (*sounds of interest*). So what is a Data Scientist and what sort of work do you do?"

> Me: "Hmmmmmm. I suggest you Google it."

As far as work is concerned, I'm particularly interested in leveraging vast amounts of data and predictive modelling to deliver actual business value - whether that's incremental revenue or improved operational efficiencies.

Aside from work, I'm into music, food, football and food...o, and food.
